There are 29687 problems in the dataset consisting of equalities between
pair of programs (smallest and fastest according to some abstract time) generating the same OEIS sequence. Therefore, there is at most one problem per OEIS sequence.

## Set of problems
The problems are available in the directory `pb`.

## Subsets of problems
The list of problems passing the syntactic check for induction 
is given in `aind_syn`.
The list of problems passing the syntactic check and the semantic check for induction is given in `aind_sem`.
